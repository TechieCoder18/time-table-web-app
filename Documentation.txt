Terms & Conditions for Timetable Web Application
This document outlines the necessary data requirements and operational constraints for the proper functioning of the Timetable Web Application.

1. Required CSV Files
To use the Timetable Web Application, users must upload the following three CSV files:

	Educator.csv

	Batch.csv

	Leaves.csv

    Note:

	Educator.csv and Batch.csv should be created based on the planned lecture schedules.

	Leaves.csv must be updated and uploaded on a weekly basis.


2. Handling Educator Leaves and Batch Off Days
If any educator is on planned leave for a specific batch on a particular day, the corresponding cell in Leaves.csv must be filled with the term Planned Leave.

If there are no classes scheduled for a batch on a specific day, the term Batch Off must be filled for all educators of that batch on that day in the Leaves.csv.

    Example:
	If Batch1 has no classes on Monday, then for each educator assigned to Batch1, the Monday column in Leaves.csv 	should contain Batch Off.


3. Batch-wise Leave Details
The Leaves.csv file must contain batch-wise entries.

If an educator is assigned to multiple batches, their leave details must be specified separately for each batch.


4. Consistency in Naming
It is imperative that the following data entries remain consistent across all CSV files:

	Subject Names

	Goals

	Educator Names

	Batch UIDs

     Inconsistencies in naming conventions will result in errors or incorrect timetable generation.


5. CSV Structure Requirements
All CSV files must retain their original column headings as defined by the application.

Modifying or renaming any heading will prevent the file from uploading and will disrupt the timetable generation process.


6. Lecture Frequency Constraints
The total number of lectures assigned to educators must not exceed the number of available time slots for any batch.

   If this constraint is violated:

	The timetable may fail to generate, or

	The system will automatically reduce the number of scheduled lectures to fit the available time slots.
